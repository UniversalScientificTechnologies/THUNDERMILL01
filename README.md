# THUNDERMILL01 - Electric field sensor 

THUNDERMILL01 is on open-source [Electric field mill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_mill) sensor for static, portable and airborne measurements. Device is equipted with opensource software, that provides high flexibility from the point of view of data output. The sophisticated design of the sensor provides the ability to use the sensor for many applications. The sensor can be operated statically at a fixed location, on mobile measuring devices or may be mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles. 


## Version for airborne measurement on board UAV

In case of arborne measurement by UAV the sensor should be a part of TF-ATMON system. TF-ATOMON system provides data real-time transmission to the ground station where they are visualized in 3D map and provides the drone operator with a fast and flexible response to the measured data.

The sensor is standartly operated as part of the [ThunderFly TF-G2](https://github.com/ThunderFly-aerospace/TF-G2/) autogyro drone. 


## Portable Version for car or stationary measurements
