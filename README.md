# THUNDERMILL01 - Electric field sensor 

THUNDERMILL01 is an open-source [Electric field mill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_mill) sensor for static, portable and airborne measurements. The device is equipped with an open-source software that provides high flexibility from the point of view of data output. The sophisticated design of the sensor provides the ability to use the sensor for many applications. The sensor can be operated statically at a fixed location or on mobile measuring devices or may be mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles. 

## Version for airborne measurements on board UAV

In case of arborne measurements by UAV the sensor is intended be used with [TF-ATMON](https://www.thunderfly.cz/tf-atmon.html) system. [TF-ATMON system](https://www.thunderfly.cz/tf-atmon.html) provides real-time data transmission to the ground station where it is visualized in a 3D map and provides the drone operator with a fast and flexible response to the measured data. 


The sensor is commonly operated equipped on the [ThunderFly TF-G2](https://github.com/ThunderFly-aerospace/TF-G2/) autogyro drone.
